Activity 1 
1. In static storage global variables are stored. The stack stores all local
variables. The heap is where dynamic malloc variables are stored.
2. a) Three variables are declared.
   b) Two of them are pointers. ptr points to an int, handle points to an int pointer. 
   c) num is stored on the stack, ptr and handle are stored on the heap.
   d) ptr will point to the stack memory pool.
3. Drawing made on paper and shown to TA.
4. Drawing made.

Activity 2
1. The program creates a struct with three members. Two of them being numbers int and float 
initialized to 5 and 3.14 respectively. The next is a pointer to the next struct node. 
2. Addresses and values were printed.
3. The address of the head and the first member variable of the head share the same address,
each variable after that is 4 memory locations apart from eachother. This means that all members 
of a struct have their memory saved at the same time and are reserved one after another with the 
head and first member ariable sharing the same address. 

Assignment 1
1. a) We need to pass the size of the array to the function because in c there is no built in 
   function to return the size of the array so it must be passed.
   b) The original array is unchanged at the end of the sort function. 
   c) A new array is needed because the way main was coded it wants to have two arrays, the sorted and 
   unsorted arrays, thus the new sorted array must be returned so that the original array is 
   preserved.
