Activity 4

Averages Pseudocode:

sumPos
sumNeg
curr
posNum
negNum


while curr is not zero
	curr = user number 
	if its positive add it to sumPos increment posNum
	else if negative add to sumNeg increment negNum
	


output positive average sumPos/posNum
output neg average sumNeg/negNum
