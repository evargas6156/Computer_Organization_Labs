Activity 1
1. MARS stands for: MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator
2. MARS downloaded and installed.
3. Downloaded tutorial materials. 
4. a) To load a file use file->open or the open ion.
   b) Assemble the program using the assemble icon. looks like wrench and screwdriver. 
   c) You run the program using the run button, looks like a play button.
   d) You cannot run a program before assembling.
   e) To run a program line by line use the single step icon, a play button with a subscripted 1
   f) To rerun after you must click the reset (skip backwards button) and then hit the run button

Activity 2
1. .data - The following data items should be stored in the data segment
   .text - The next items are put in the user text segment
   .word - Store the n 32 but quantities in succesive memory words
2. Line 10 branches to the finish label if the value in register $t3 is equal to 0.
3. Line 15 jumps to the fib label
4. To set a breakpoint go to the execute tab after assembling and check the breakpoint box
   on each line a breakpoint is desired. 
5. To continue to execute your code after the breakpoint click the step button once. To step 
   through the code start it through the signle step button and click to step another line.
6. To see the content of a register look at the register tab and find the correspoding register.
   To manually modify the value of the register double ckick its value and type in the desired 
   value.
7. N is stored at address 0x10010000. Changed value to 13 to calculate 13th fib number. 
8. MIPS syscall is a special instruction used in MIPS instruction set to do a service. It is a 
   “Software Interrupt ” to invoke OS for an action. MIPS syscall instruction provides many 
   services. It may be to print a number or to terminate a program. Has about 39 MIPS syscall 
   services.
