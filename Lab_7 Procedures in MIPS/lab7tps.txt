Activity 1
1. A procedure is a set of code that performs a specific task. A function can be called by 
   name and can return a value. A method is very similar to a function except the method are
   associated to a class or object. 
2. N/A
3. Created proc1.c
4. j SUM jumps to line 20, which then adds into register $v0 the values stored at $a0 and $a1. 
5. j should not be used as if the function is called multiple times in main it would always 
   return to the same spot in the code.
6. The return address is supposed to be saved in line 11, but instead zero is saved into 
   the return address, this doesnt make sense as zero is not the correct pointer to the 
   current line of code. 
7. The program terminates due to an invalid program counter. 
8. Sum should return to address: 0x00400020
9. A different memory address was saved. 
10.The new address is 0x00400028 and the output is 15. 
11.jal should be used to automatically save the return address. 
12.Edited code to use jal.

Activity 2
1. The output will be 38. 
2. The mips code has procedures for all the c functions in the program. 
3. SUM knows where to return since jal was used, saving the address, thus address however is 
   overwritten when jal SUB runs, thus the first return address must be temporarily saved. 
4. Instead of storing the address in a temporary register, it can be stored in memory and
   loaded again when needed.
5. The code at line 25 is a oroblem as $s0 value will be overwritten, to prevent this save 
   $s0's value into memory first.
